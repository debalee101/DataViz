# Spirographs/Parametric Plot

Here I have tried to replicate the Excess Death visualization made by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker). The original visualization was made using R. I have used the *[Spirographs and Parametric plots in Stata](https://medium.com/the-stata-gallery/spirographs-and-parametric-plots-in-stata-960e332aa035)* by *[Asjad Naqvi](https://asjadnaqvi.github.io/)* and the *[Stata Graph Replication: The Economistâ€™s Covid-19 Excess Death visualization](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide/graph-replication-the-economists-covid-19-excess-death-graph-c6b2bc65f760)* by *Farhad Mirza* as references while replicating the same.

## The final graph looks like:
